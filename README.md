# weekend-challenge-2
## To Do
- [x] Source in files to index.html
- [x] Set up server
- [x] Create 2 input fields + button for type of math operation in index.html
- [x] Put input values and math operation in object
- [x] Send object to server with POST 
- [x] Build server logic to compute numbers
- [x] Send calculation back to client 
- [x] Append calculation to DOM
- [] Build clear button to reset the page

##Hard mode, still to do:
- [x] Find a way to append the text of the buttons clicked to the <p> tag above it
    - [] Specifically, append so that the numbers are concatenated into one new number
- [] Append the operator to the <p> tag above it
- [] Change the object I'm sending to the server so that the number variables are now the value in the <p> tag, instead of the input field values
- [] Change the clear button so that the result field is empty
